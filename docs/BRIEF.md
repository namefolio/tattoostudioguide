Evidence (no search volumes were available; none are claimed):
- **Entity noun "tattoo shop".** Yelp's US category and search pages use "Tattoo Shops" (yelp.com search for Houston, Denver, Bozeman, Saint Paul); US listicles use "tattoo shops" (do303.com "Denver's Top Tattoo Shops"); many US shops call themselves "tattoo shop" (ritualtattoogallery.com, nyctattooshop.com). "Studio" is the brand word, so titles pair them: "Tattoo Shops & Studios in {City}, {ST}".
- **Location modifiers:** "near me" and "in {city}, {ST}" forms dominate Yelp and shop pages; the city is the level people choose at; state is the hub level. Neighborhoods are left for later, when big cities have enough listings.
- **Walk-ins matter:** Yelp has dedicated "Tattoo Shops Walk Ins" pages per city; many shops lead with "Walk-ins welcome" (livebytheswordtattoo.com, rabblerousertattoo.com, chitowntattoo.com).
- **Styles:** US shops advertise fine line, traditional, realism, blackwork etc. (noregrets.tattoo, tatship.com style lists).
- **Common questions** (shop FAQ pages, e.g. clubtattoo.com/pages/faqs, bayinktattoo.com/faq, sortra.com on deposits): how much does it cost / shop minimum, deposit, walk-ins or appointment, ID and age (18+, some allow 16+ with parental consent by state), cover-ups, bring your own design, aftercare.
- **Who ranks now** (Houston TX = large, Denver CO = mid, Bozeman MT = small): Yelp everywhere; editorial listicles (Westword, do303) in Denver; shop sites and Facebook pages in Bozeman. Gaps: listicles give no hours, walk-in policy, minimums or license info (do303 checked); Yelp mixes ratings with ads. Nobody states when details were last checked.
- **Credential:** US tattoo shops are licensed by the state or local health department, and several states publish a free lookup (Texas DSHS public license search; Florida DOH establishment licensing; Minnesota MDH body art licenses). Check wording: "we check the shop's tattoo establishment license with the state or local health department that issues it, and confirm the details with the owner".
- **schema.org type:** `TattooParlor`.

## Design direction

Redesigned 2026-09-30 at the owner's request ("premium, independent tattoo-studio discovery directory, not Yelp"). The earlier flash-sheet direction is replaced by:

- **Feel:** high-end tattoo magazine + editorial directory. Warm ivory paper, near-black ink, thin 1px rules, 2px corners, no shadows, a faint paper grain on the hero and flash-sheet hatching as the image placeholder.
- **Type:** Instrument Serif (display, self-hosted, OFL, `font-display: optional` so headlines never shift) for H1/H2, card titles and the style index; Atkinson Hyperlegible Next for body and UI. Uppercase tracked wordmark.
- **Accent:** one oxblood red (`#9f2a1c`) for the Verified check, kickers, focus rings and hover underlines. Buttons are ink.
- **Home order:** hero (headline, search, popular style chips + walk-ins) → launch state while fewer than `ui.launchThreshold` listings → Explore by style (numbered editorial index) → Explore by city (only past the launch state, real counts) → studios → Why TattooStudioGuide (restates existing policies) → owner CTA band → FAQs.
- **Nav:** Studios (`/studios/`, search), Styles (`/styles/`), Cities (`/tattoo-shops/`), Add a studio. Mobile menu is a `<details>` element (no JS).
- **Cards:** image or placeholder (4:3), serif name, city, Verified mark, top 3 styles, up to 3 practical flags, "View studio →". Whole card is one link.
- **Studio page:** name, address, Verified mark → gallery (or placeholder) → Styles, About, From the owner, then Visit / Opening hours / Information panels (sticky on desktop, right after About on mobile) → Good to know (only published facts) → FAQs → nearby studios. "Information last checked {date}" and "Report incorrect information" on every listing.
- **Search:** static index at `/data/search.json`; the script understands styles (with synonyms like "colour", "script"), walk-ins, "verified", and matches the rest against name, street, city, state and ZIP ("fine line austin"). Filters show only for facts present in the data.
- **Map:** no tile provider yet. `site.map` is `null`; cards carry `data-lat`/`data-lng` and `.results-layout.has-map` reserves the right-hand column, so a map can be added without reworking pages.
- **Photos:** optional `images` per listing, files in `src/assets/listings/{slug}/`, resized to WebP `srcset` at build.
